#  Movieland

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT: This is a React API application used to search for films.

#  How's it made 

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS

Using the core technologies of HTML, CSS and Javascript as the foundation, and using the popular Javascript Library, React, I built a movie database search application.  

The app calls the omdbapi to fetch the data.

The app uses the useEffect React hook to initialize the page.  The app uses a Universally Unique Identifier or UUID function to create unique IDs for mapping andkeeping track of each task.

#  Optimizations

  App could be optimized to save the data either locally or to a backend database, among other improvements.

#  Lessons Learned:

The map function is an especially powerful and useful tool when working with lists in React.
